        The streets of South Africa are ruthless. In the heart of the taxi industry, every route is a battle, every fare has a price, and every empire demands blood.
        
        When the Dlamini family patriarch is assassinated in a violent taxi war, his sons inherit more than a business. They inherit a legacy of power, violence, and betrayal.
        
        Sibusiso "Sbu" Dlamini, the responsible elder, wants to honor his father’s memory by building a legitimate empire. He dreams of order, respect, and a future free from guns and bloodshed.
        
        "Mfundo Dlamini", the younger brother, has grown up in the shadows of the streets. Impulsive, hot-headed, and ruthless, he believes only fear and strength can ensure survival.
        
        Torn between love, loyalty, and ambition, the brothers’ bond fractures as the city’s most dangerous rivalries close in. Drivers, communities, and families are caught in the crossfire, and every choice could be fatal.
        
        In a world where every street is a battlefield and every relationship a potential betrayal, only one question matters: Who will survive the empire?
